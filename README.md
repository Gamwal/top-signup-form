## Sign Up Form - Code Readme

This project is a basic sign-up form with a modern design. It uses HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript for client-side password validation.

**Features:**

* Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
* Background image with a slight blur effect.
* Clear and concise form with input fields for first name, last name, email, phone number, password, and confirm password.
* Client-side validation to ensure passwords match (indicated with a red border).
* Submit button with a subtle shadow effect.
* Login link at the bottom of the form.
* Photo credit section with links to the photographer and Unsplash.

**Technologies Used:**

* HTML: Used for creating the basic structure of the page and form.
* CSS: Used for styling the layout, form elements, typography, colors, and responsiveness.
* JavaScript (optional): Used for basic client-side password match validation.

**Setup Instructions:**

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see the sign-up form.

**Customization:**

* You can easily customize the styles in the `styles.css` file to match your branding.
* Replace the placeholder image (`images/declan-sun-unsplash-reduced.jpg`) with your own background image.
* Edit the content of the form labels and photo credit section as needed.
* The JavaScript for password validation is included as a basic example. You can modify it or implement server-side validation for added security.
